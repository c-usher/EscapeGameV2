## Aproach:

#### Overview:

I started by breaking down the game in 4 different game states. Main game state, combat state, boss combat state and the win state. I then created a list of actions the player can take in the game. With arrows I connected each action to the actor of the different game states and color coded them.

Once the actions and states were paired and broken down. I made the wire frames next to them for each game state. Keeping them color coded.

## Stretch Goals:

* Getting the enemy image to move back and forth when it attacked.

* Having the reset button working properly.

## Challenge:

1. My biggest challenge I faced was getting the reset button to work properly. It was not clearing out the enemies killed.

2. Another challenge I encountered was getting the image to move left and right when it attacks. A lot of my issues I was having was syntax and after some googling and taking a break I was able to get it to work.
